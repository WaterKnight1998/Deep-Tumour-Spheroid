# Deep-Tumour-Spheroid

The aim of this repository is to improve the automatic segmentation of Glioblastoma Multiforme Tumors (GBM) by using Deep Learning. GBMs are the most frequent, aggressive and lethal of all primary brain tumors.

This repository contains all the resources needed for training the models: several datasets and the notebooks.

In addition, it will provide an easy way for using the models.
